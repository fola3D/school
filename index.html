            <h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>The Civil War was when some southern states left the country and started their own country called the Confederate States of America due to their not being equal free and slave states. The south believed that without slavery , there would be no south , which they were somewhat right , as slavery was really the only way to become rich in the south. Because of this , a civil war started , and to weaken the south , Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation , stating that all persons held as slaves" within the rebellious states(the southern states that left) are, and henceforward shall be free. This freed all slaves in the southern states but not the Union. After the Civil war , When the USA was one again,The Thirteenth Amendment, passed in January of 1865, was implemented. It abolished slavery entirely.</p>
<p>Reconstruction (1865-1877), the era following the Civil War, was the effort to restore Southern states from the Confederacy and newly-freed people into the United States.</p>
<p>After the Reconstruction era, racial inequality was across the South during the 1870s, and the segregationist policies called Jim Crow Affected Black Southerners Negatively.</p>
<p>Black Southerners were still forced to make their living working the land due to Black codes and the sharecropping system, which offered little economic opportunity. And while the Ku Klux Klan had been officially disbanded in 1869, the KKK continued underground after that, and intimidation and violence of Black southerners were not uncommon actions in the South.</p>
<p>All of this led to millions of Black Southerners to move to the north where states are more pro-black Americans.</p>

        <h2>Jim Crow Laws</h2>
        <h3>type:cause</h3>
<img src="lockin.webp" class="side">
        <p>Jim Crow laws were a collection of state and city laws that were focused on taking the rights of African Americans.</p>
        <p>The roots of Jim Crow laws began as early as 1865, immediately after the 13th Amendment was passed. Black codes were city and state laws that said when, where and how Black Americans could work, and for how much compensation.</p>
        <p>The legal system was unfair for Black citizens due to former Confederate soldiers being police , judges, etc; making it almost impossible for African Americans to win court cases and ensuring they were submitted to Black codes.</p>

        <section id="black">
        <h2>Black Codes</h2>
        <h3>Type: cause</h3>
        <p>Black codes were laws made to decrease the freedom of African Americans and to make sure they are still a cheap labor source after slavery was stopped during the Civil War. Under black codes, many states required Black people to sign yearly labor contracts. If they didn't sign, they risked being arrested and forced into labor. Outrage over black codes helped undermine support for President Andrew Johnson and the Republican Party.</p>

        <h2>Sharecropping System</h2>
        <h3>Type: cause</h3>
        <p>Sharecropping is a type of farming in which families rent small plots of land from a landowner in return for a portion of their crop, to be given to the landowner at the end of each year. With the southern economy in disarray after the abolition of slavery and the devastation of the Civil War, sharecropping enabled landowners to establish a labor force, while giving poor whites and freed Black people a means of subsistence.</p>

        <section id="KKK">
            <h2>KKK(in the time period)</h2>
            <h3>type:cause</h3>
            <img class="side" src="KU-KLUX.jpg" width="300px" length="300px">
            <p>The Ku Klux Klan, commonly shortened to the KKK or the Klan, is the name of several historical and current American white supremacist, far-right terrorist organizations and hate groups. The Klan was "the first organized terror movement in American history.</p>
            <p>On December 24, 1865 the kkk was founded in Pulaski, Tennessee.</p>
            <p>The KKK was made to suppress reconstruction reforms and seeks to restore white supremacy through terrorist activity, including intimidation against freed colored people and their white Republican allies.</p>

    <h2>The Great Migration Begins</h2>
    <h3>type:effect</h3>
    <p>When World War I broke out in Europe , industrialized urban areas in the North, Midwest and West faced a shortage of industrial laborers. With war production becoming high , recruiters told Black Americans to come north, to the dismay of white Southerners.</p>
<p>By the end of 1919, some scholars estimate that 1 million Black people had left the South, usually traveling by train, boat or bus; a smaller number had automobiles or even horse-drawn carts. In the decade between 1910 and 1920, the Black population of major Northern cities grew by large percentages, including New York City by 66%, Chicago by 148% , Philadelphia by 500% and Detroit by a whopping 611%.</p>
<p>Many new arrivals found jobs in factories, slaughterhouses and foundries, where working conditions were sometimes dangerous. Female migrants had a harder time finding work, due to heated competition for domestic labor positions. Aside from competition for employment, there was also competition for living space in increasingly crowded cities. While segregation was not legalized in the North (as it was in the South), racism and prejudice were still common.

    <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
    <h3>type : effect</h3>
    <img class="side" src="harhar.jpg">
    <p>After The Supreme Court declared racially based housing ordinances unconstitutional in 1917, some residential neighborhoods enacted covenants requiring white property owners to agree not to sell to Black people; these were legal until the Court stopped them in 1948.</p>
<p>Rising rents in segregated areas, plus an increase of KKK activity after 1915, worsened Black and white relations across the country. The summer of 1919 began the greatest period of interracial conflict in U.S. history at that time, including a wave of race riots.</p>
<p>One of these was The Chicago Race Riot of 1919 which lasted for 13 days and left 38 people dead, 537 injured and 1,000 Black families without homes.</p>
<p>Due to problems with Housing , Many Black residents ended up creating their own cities within big cities. The most prominent example was Harlem in New York City that housed about 200,000 Black people.</p>
<p>After moving to the northern states, African Americans were inspired to be creative in different ways. The Great Migration resulted in the Harlem Renaissance, which was also fueled by immigrants from the Caribbean, and the Chicago Black Renaissance.</p>

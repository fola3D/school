            <h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>The Civil War was when some southern states left the country and started their own country called the Confederate States of America due to their not being equal free and slave states. The south believed that without slavery , there would be no south , which they were somewhat right , as slavery was really the only way to become rich in the south. Because of this , a civil war started , and to weaken the south , Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation , stating that all persons held as slaves" within the rebellious states(the southern states that left) are, and henceforward shall be free. This freed all slaves in the southern states but not the Union. After the Civil war , When the USA was one again,The Thirteenth Amendment, passed in January of 1865, was implemented. It abolished slavery entirely.</p>
<p>Reconstruction (1865-1877), the era following the Civil War, was the effort to restore Southern states from the Confederacy and newly-freed people into the United States.</p>
<p>After the Reconstruction era, racial inequality was across the South during the 1870s, and the segregationist policies called Jim Crow Affected Black Southerners Negatively.</p>
<p>Black Southerners were still forced to make their living working the land due to Black codes and the sharecropping system, which offered little economic opportunity. And while the Ku Klux Klan had been officially disbanded in 1869, the KKK continued underground after that, and intimidation and violence of Black southerners were not uncommon actions in the South.</p>
<p>All of this led to millions of Black Southerners to move to the north where states are more pro-black Americans.</p>

        <h2>Jim Crow Laws</h2>
        <h3>type:cause</h3>
        <p>Jim Crow laws were a collection of state and city laws that were focused on taking the rights of African Americans.</p>
        <p>The roots of Jim Crow laws began as early as 1865, immediately after the 13th Amendment was passed. Black codes were city and state laws that said when, where and how Black Americans could work, and for how much compensation.</p>
        <p>The legal system was unfair for Black citizens due to former Confederate soldiers being police , judges, etc; making it almost impossible for African Americans to win court cases and ensuring they were submitted to Black codes.</p>
